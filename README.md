# Genomic Sequence Modeling using RNNs and GenAI Explanations

## Overview
This project is an academic, AI Intern–level implementation of genomic / biological
sequence modeling using recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM).

The goal is to study how different RNN-based architectures learn patterns
from nucleotide sequences and compare their performance.
An optional GenAI (LLM-based) explanation layer is added to generate
human-readable summaries of model predictions.

⚠️ This project is for educational and experimental purposes only.
It does NOT claim biological, medical, or clinical applicability.

## Problem Statement
Given a fixed-length nucleotide sequence composed of A, C, G, and T,
the task is to predict whether the sequence contains splice-like patterns
using sequence modeling techniques.

This is framed as a binary classification problem:
- 1 → splice-like pattern present
- 0 → non-splice sequence

## Dataset
**Primary Dataset:** Synthetic genomic sequences

- Randomly generated nucleotide sequences (A, C, G, T)
- Fixed sequence length (e.g., 60 bases)
- Labels generated by injecting known splice-like motifs (e.g., GT...AG)

### Why Synthetic Data?
- Fully reproducible
- No ethical or biological risk
- Allows controlled experimentation
- Keeps the project interview-safe and academic

The same pipeline can be extended to publicly available datasets
(e.g., UCI Splice Junction sequences) if required.

## Sequence Encoding
Sequences are converted into machine-learning–friendly format using:

### One-Hot Encoding
Each nucleotide is represented as a 4-dimensional vector:

| Nucleotide | Encoding |
|-----------|----------|
| A | [1, 0, 0, 0] |
| C | [0, 1, 0, 0] |
| G | [0, 0, 1, 0] |
| T | [0, 0, 0, 1] |

Final input shape:
